2. Open the newly created repository in Codespace using the [Codespace button extension](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).

## 📝 Instructions

Read the contents of the `./INSTRUCTIONS.md` file containing the steps to complete the project, follow them and develop the solution first in `./src/explore.ipynb` for testing and then move the clean code to `./src/app.py`. Be sure to delete the notebook once you no longer need it to keep the project clean and tidy.

> Note: We also incorporated the solution samples on ./src/solution.md that we strongly suggest you only use if you are stuck for more than 30 min or if you have already finished and want to compare it with your approach.
